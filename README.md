## 💭Course Reflection
>The mathematical concepts underlying the entire scope of computer science were understood through this course. Initially, abstract topics such as set theory, logic, and proof techniques were perceived as difficult to comprehend. However, as the course progressed, the relevance of these concepts was recognized, and their role in the development of integral computing logic was clarified.
>
>Problem analysis abilities were strengthened significantly by the study of relations, functions, and recurrence relations. Furthermore, analytical skills for real-world problem-solving were improved through the application of counting methods and probability.
>
>The practical application of mathematical theory was most clearly demonstrated by graph theory and trees, particularly in the context of network design and shortest-path problems. Additionally, the modeling of real electronic devices through mathematical structures was taught via the study of finite automata.
>
>Although the assignments and quizzes were considered challenging, they ensured that the concepts were thoroughly practiced. Overall, critical thinking skills have been enhanced, and a solid preparation for advanced computer science courses has been established. The skills, knowledge, and experience gained are expected to be valued highly in the future.
