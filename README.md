# SECI1013 Discrete Structure
Section: 02

Lecturer: Dr. Noorfa Haszlinna binti Mustaffa

This course teaches the basic ideas of discrete structures and how they are used in computer science. It covers important topics like sets, logic, proofs, relations, functions, recurrence relations, counting, graphs, trees, and finite automata. Through these topics, students learn how to solve computer-related problems, think logically, and understand how certain systems and processes work. By the end of the course, students should be able to use these concepts to analyze problems, explain solutions clearly, and model simple electronic or computer systems using state machines.
